2. Data Structures and Types
    Data Types:
    Will use appropriate data types for each column (ex - INT for IDs, VARCHAR for names and addresses, DECIMAL for prices).
    Data Structures:
    Normalize the database to reduce redundancy (basically separate tables for pharmacies, employees, customers, medications, prescriptions, and Transaction).

3. Constraints
    Primary Keys: Ensure each table has a unique identifier.
    Foreign Keys: Implement foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity between related tables (ex - linking customers and Prescriptions).
    Unique Constraints: Ensure unique values where applicable (e.g., email addresses or phone no in Customers and Employees).
    Checks: Implement checks for data validation (e.g., ensuring stock_quantity is non-negative).
